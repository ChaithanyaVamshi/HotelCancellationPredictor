# HotelCancellationPredictor
- Have you ever wondered what if there was a way you could predict which guests who are likely to cancel the reservation at Hotel? That would be great right? Check out this ML model which gives best prediction for the guests who are likely to cancel the reservation.

# Description:
- Dataset is collected from kaggle.com
- Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, EDA and model is built to predict which guests at the Hotel are likely to cancel the reservation.
- Please check out my article published on Medium to understand Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the data set : https://medium.com/@chaithanyavamshi/exploratory-data-analysis-eda-for-predicting-hotel-booking-cancellations-using-machine-learning-3990be4af2ff#4dcf-4450f66806f0
- Applied Feature Engineering and Feature Encoding techniques like One Hot encoding, Label Encoding, Custom Mapping etc
- I have applied various Classification Algorithms on the data set like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Boosting Algorithm like XGBOOST.
- The model is successfully built and has achieved  highest accuracy of 89% with Random Forest Algorithm after applying Cross Validaton Techniques.
- Applied Hyper Parameter tuning using GridSearchCV to get the best score and best parameters for building the model.
- Built a web app using Python and Streamlit library.
- Deployed the Model on Heroku. Please do check out the web app : https://hotel-cancel-predictor.herokuapp.com/
